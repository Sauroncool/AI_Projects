create a dictionary called {Graph} with each key's values being a
list of its corresponding node's neighbours and their separation

start = <start_node>
goal = <goal_node>

create a dictionary called {H_dist} with each key's
values being each node's estimated distance to the goal

define heuristic function(n)
    return {H_dist[n]}

define output(path)
    print the path in the format the user wants (this could be omitted as well)
    return path

define generate()
    if the problem isn't already defined as a tree, then formulate it here
    instead of {Graph}, generate children of each node and append it to {Graph}
    return
